# Ground Level Stories

Micro audio stories built from a tightly controlled Level 0 vocabulary.

## Philosophy

Language should begin at the ground level:
- Concrete
- Literal
- Stress-free
- No translation
- No testing pressure

This project explores a minimal, audio-first graded reader system for absolute beginners.

## MVP

- 5 micro stories
- Level 0 vocabulary (~75 words)
- Audio + text
- Optional priming screen
- No quizzes (yet)
